Global Scope :=>
Variables declared outside any function or block are in the global scope.
These variables are accessible throughout the entire script, including inside functions and blocks.
Variables in Global Scope are declared using var, let, or const at the top level.

Function Scope :=> 
Variables declared with var inside a function are accessible only within that function.
Variables declared using var inside a function.

Block Scope :=> 
Variables declared with let or const are accessible only within the block "{}" in which they are defined or inside the if else statement as shown in the code.
These variables can only be declared using let and const for better code writing.
If we declare a variable using var keyword then that varibale can also be accessible ouside the block, which will generate unnesseray bugs in our code.
